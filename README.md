## Express.js Program Controller Linux Edition

Express.js Program Controller for Linux is a sample node express.js server that allows you to start, stop, or restart programs remotely.

**NOTE:** Express.js Program Controller is getting developed by a person who doesn't have a lot of knowledge about node and express.js. The updates may probably take hours or days to do, and a lot of time of searching the web on how to do this and that.

**Linux Edition** of Express.js Program Controller may have some features removed or not.
